# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive store management system that extends the existing tenant-based architecture. Each tenant will have a main store created automatically during tenant creation, with the ability to create additional sub-stores for multi-store operations. The system will manage inventory batch allocations across stores, implement store-scoped user permissions, and provide a store context similar to the existing tenant context. All inventory items remain tied to the main store, while inventory batches can be allocated to any store within the tenant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tenant owner, I want a main store to be automatically created when my tenant is created, so that I can immediately start managing inventory and sales operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new tenant is created THEN the system SHALL automatically create a main store for that tenant
2. WHEN the main store is created THEN it SHALL be marked as the primary store with isMain flag set to true
3. WHEN the tenant creation transaction fails THEN the main store creation SHALL also be rolled back
4. WHEN the main store is created THEN it SHALL inherit the tenant's basic information (name, contact details)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tenant owner with multi-store operations, I want to create additional sub-stores, so that I can manage multiple locations under my tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant has storeType set to MULTI_STORE THEN the system SHALL allow creation of additional stores
2. WHEN creating a sub-store THEN it SHALL be linked to the tenant and marked with isMain flag set to false
3. WHEN a tenant has storeType set to SINGLE_STORE THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of additional stores
4. WHEN creating a sub-store THEN it SHALL require a unique name within the tenant scope

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all inventory items to be tied to the main store, so that there is a centralized inventory management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating inventory THEN it SHALL be automatically associated with the tenant's main store
2. WHEN querying inventory THEN it SHALL always reference the main store relationship
3. WHEN a tenant is created THEN all existing inventory creation flows SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want inventory batches to be allocated to specific stores, so that each store can only sell from its allocated inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating inventory batch allocations THEN they SHALL be assigned to specific stores
2. WHEN a store attempts to sell inventory THEN it SHALL only access batches allocated to that store
3. WHEN viewing available inventory THEN users SHALL only see batches allocated to their current store
4. WHEN allocating batches THEN the total allocated quantity SHALL not exceed the batch's remaining quantity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tenant owner, I want users to be assigned to specific stores, so that access and operations are properly scoped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating user-tenant relationships THEN users SHALL be assigned to a specific store
2. WHEN a user has super admin or tenant owner role THEN they SHALL have access to all stores within the tenant
3. WHEN a regular user logs in THEN their operations SHALL be scoped to their assigned store
4. WHEN assigning users to stores THEN the store SHALL belong to the same tenant as the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a store context middleware similar to tenant context, so that store-scoped operations are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL extract and validate store context from request headers or tokens
2. WHEN store context is established THEN it SHALL be available throughout the request lifecycle
3. WHEN store context is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN no store context is provided THEN the system SHALL default to the user's assigned store

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want store permissions integrated into the existing role-based access control, so that store-specific permissions work seamlessly with current authorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining permissions THEN the SubjectEnum SHALL include Store as a new subject
2. WHEN checking permissions THEN store-specific permissions SHALL be evaluated alongside existing permissions
3. WHEN a user has store management permissions THEN they SHALL be able to perform CRUD operations on stores within their tenant
4. WHEN existing permission checks run THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a sales person, I want to only sell inventory batches allocated to my store, so that inventory tracking remains accurate across all stores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating sales THEN the system SHALL verify inventory batch allocation to the user's store
2. WHEN processing inventory reservations THEN they SHALL respect store-based batch allocations
3. WHEN completing sales THEN inventory quantities SHALL be deducted from the correct store's allocation
4. WHEN viewing sales history THEN it SHALL be filtered by the user's store context

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the store implementation to integrate seamlessly without breaking existing functionality, so that current operations continue uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the store system is implemented THEN existing inventory batch reservations SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN existing APIs are called THEN they SHALL work without requiring immediate migration
3. WHEN database migrations run THEN existing data SHALL be preserved and properly migrated
4. WHEN new store features are added THEN they SHALL not affect existing tenant-scoped operations
