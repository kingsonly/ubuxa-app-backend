// Simplified Batch-Aware Store Inventory
// Single model approach - handles both aggregate and batch-specific inventory

// Note: This replaces the complex multi-model approach with a single unified model
// When inventoryBatchId is NULL = aggregate inventory
// When inventoryBatchId is SET = batch-specific inventory
